The application has a role for IFA Public Affairs Officers and one for the developers for privileged permissions, respectively. Only the latter can access or change administrative and security configurations and related data.\n\nThe Django Framework and Django REST Framework (DRF), by default, allows any user with the `is_staff` role attribute to access administrative functions in an application using the framework. IFA GoodRead developers have disabled this behavior, relying on the custom roles identified in the relevant section.\n\nFor the IFA GoodRead database, the system account and accredentials for the application to read and write to the system datastore has specific read and write authorization for specific tables. This database service account does not have full administrative permissions to add, modify, or delete all respective tables. For the production environment, only the IFA GoodRead developer has a dedicated account with equivalent permissions. Only local network socket access, within in the Linux server, is permitted by host firewall configuration. Remote access, privileged or unprivileged, is not allowed remotely and the system engineer must locally authenticate for access.\n\nFor the RedHat Linux server upon which the IFA GoodRead application is deployed in this system, only the system engineer has a non-privileged user to log in remotely via the SSH protocol to perform ad-hoc inspection, monthly log review as required by policy and procedure, and emergency debugging of the system. Privileged system administration operations may only be performed with the `sudo` subsystem which requires a password, two-factor authentication, and has enhanced logging of all commands executed. The system engineer must log in remotely and then use `sudo` to elevate privileges. Remote access with the privileged account is prohibited by configuration and attempts are logged.\n\nFor this remote SSH access, least privilege is additionally enforced by allowing this access via a specific network zone in the IFA GoodRead AwesomeCloud account accessible to only the system engineer via IFA's VPN solution, which requires the system engineer use a dedicated account with their own password and two-factor authentication token.\n\nFor cloud account and API access to reconfigure the Linux server and its load balancer, administrative access is only allowed for the system engineer via a special AwesomeCloud IAM role. The authentication and authorization for this role is controlled by an integration with the organization's single sign-on solution. This solution will only be accessible and correctly execute for them when they are on the VPN with their account with traffic forwarded to the appropriate network zone in the IFA GoodRead account in AwesomeCloud. It will not work the developer or any staff users of the application.",
